    <h2> <em> Bio</em> </h2>
    <p1> My name is Edgar Paramo Soto. I am currently 26 years old. I first attended California State University, Monterey Bay from 2014 to 2019. I first started studying Business for 2 years before I switched over to Computer Science. BEST DECISION EVER.
    </p1>
    <p1> Soon after I joined the programming team. From there, I competed in ICPC @ UC Berkeley! The trip was sponsored by Meta(Facebook at the time).</p1>
    <p1> Since I was involved with Facebook during my undergrad, I was constantly doing mock interviews along with doing interview prep with a personal Facebook Engineer.</p1>
    <p1> She was actually the one that believed I could become a TA. Next semester, I was hired as a Teaching Assistant for Data Structures under Dr. Byun's mentorship.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p1> Unfortunately, during my last year my depression reached an all-time low and I became closed off from everything. It ultimately led to me dropping out.</p1>
    <p1> 3 Years later and I am back with all this pent up coding energy!</p1>
